BACKEND TODO:
- Validate correctly the signup data before saving it to the BD (almost done)
- Create userInfo that is linked to the user with a foreign key
- Investigate how to optimize the collections of the BD -> maybe the user collection doesn't need all params for the search,
                                                           it can be stored in two separated collections
- Use JWT and other things to log in and keep up a session

FRONTEND TODO:
- Fix forms (validating at least that not all fields are empty)
- Make submit button appear only when certain reqs are done
- Progress bar?
- Delete level value from unused selectors
